# Lists #
#########
# Lists are collections of other objects collected into one place.
x <- list(1,2,3,4)
x

# Lists do not need to contain objects of the same type or length.
# We can pre-specify the names of the elements of the list:
y <- list(letters=c("a","b","c"),nums=2:3,missing=NA)
y

# Subsetting lists is done with double square brackets:
x[[1]]
x[[4]]
y[[1]]
# If a component has more than one element, we can access them using their corresponding indices:
y[[1]][2]

names(y)
# The components of the list can be accessed through their names using the symbol $
y$letters
# or by the name enclosed in square brackets
y["letters"]


z <- list(1:10, matrix(1:12,nrow=3), "Fisher")
z
names(z)
# Alternatively, we can name the components of a list using the names function:
names(z) <- c("my_vector","my_matrix","my_name")

z$my_vector
z["my_vector"]
z[[1]]


z[[2]][1,2]
z$my_matrix[1,2]

length(z)
dim(z$my_matrix)

# lapply: Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element

# apply: Apply a function over the margins of an array

# Data Frames #
###############
# Data frames are used to store tabular data.
# They are a special type of list where every element of the list has the same length.
# Each elementof the list is a column vector and the length of each column is the number of rows.
# Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column.

x <- data.frame() # creates an empty data frame


x <- data.frame(numbers = 1:4, logicals = c(T, T, F, F))

ncol(x)

x$numbers
x$logicals

t = data.frame(x = c(11,12,14), y = c(19,20,21), z = c(10,9,7))
